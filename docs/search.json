Iron exists in two oxidation states: oxidized (Fe3+) and reduced (Fe2+). In aerobic soils, Fe3+ forms stable iron oxides, contributing to the soil’s reddish, yellowish, or brownish colors. However, under anaerobic conditions, certain microbes utilize Fe3+ as an electron acceptor, reducing it to Fe2+. This process requires the presence of organic matter as an energy source and temperatures above 5°C for optimal microbial activity.\nAs Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+, the iron oxide coatings on soil mineral grains dissolve, revealing the underlying grayish colors of the mineral grains (e.g., quartz, kaolinite). This color change is a key indicator of iron reduction and prolonged soil saturation.",

    "text": "Conclusion\nUnderstanding the distribution and properties of soil parent materials in Minnesota is essential for predicting soil characteristics and interpreting the state’s diverse landscapes. The complex glacial history of Minnesota has resulted in a mosaic of parent materials, each with its unique influence on soil formation and landscape development. By recognizing the relationships between transport mechanisms, particle size sorting, and soil texture, soil scientists can better assess the potential and limitations of soils for various applications.",
