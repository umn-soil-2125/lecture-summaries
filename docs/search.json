Oxidation is the loss of electrons (OIL: Oxidation Is Loss), while reduction is the gain of electrons (RIG: Reduction Is Gain). Aerobic respiration, a crucial process for many organisms including soil microbes, is a redox reaction where organic matter (reduced carbon compounds) is oxidized to CO2, and oxygen (O2) is reduced to water (H2O). The chemical energy released during this process is used to synthesize ATP.",

However, in saturated soils, oxygen becomes depleted, leading to anaerobic conditions. Under such circumstances, facultative anaerobic microorganisms utilize alternative electron acceptors in a sequence determined by the energy yield: nitrate (NO3-), manganese (Mn4+), iron (Fe3+), sulfate (SO42-), and carbon dioxide (CO2).",

    "text": "2.4 Iron Reduction and Soil Color Changes\nIron reduction is a critical process in the formation of redoximorphic features. Iron exists in two oxidation states: oxidized (Fe3+) and reduced (Fe2+). In aerobic soils, Fe3+ forms stable iron oxides, contributing to the soil’s reddish, yellowish, or brownish colors. However, under anaerobic conditions, certain microbes utilize Fe3+ as an electron acceptor, reducing it to Fe2+. This process requires the presence of organic matter as an energy source and temperatures above 5°C for optimal microbial activity.\nAs Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+, the iron oxide coatings on soil mineral grains dissolve, revealing the underlying grayish colors of the mineral grains (e.g., quartz, kaolinite). This color change is a key indicator of iron reduction and prolonged soil saturation.",

However, this oxidation process occurs in a non-uniform manner, resulting in the formation of redoximorphic features:\n\nRedox concentrations: Localized areas with high iron content, appearing as reddish, brownish, or yellowish patches.\nRedox depletions: Areas depleted in iron, characterized by grayish or whitish colors.\n\nThese features are indicative of fluctuating water tables and alternating periods of soil saturation and aeration.",

Septic systems rely on the soil’s ability to treat wastewater through microbial processes. Soils with high water tables or shallow bedrock are unsuitable for conventional in-ground septic systems, as they may result in the surfacing of untreated wastewater. Soil scientists assess the presence and depth of redoximorphic features to determine the suitability of a site for septic system installation. In cases where conventional systems are not feasible, alternative designs, such as mound systems, may be recommended.",
